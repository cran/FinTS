Changes in Version 0.4-9

  o removed package 'distrEx' from 'Suggests'.

  o fixed 'inst/scripts/ch01.R' to not throw error if a package needed for an
    example is not installed.


Changes in Version 0.4-8

  o fixed CRAN NOTEs 'Lost braces in \itemize; meant \describe ?'.
  

Changes in Version 0.4-7

  o 'FinTS-package.Rd' contained hard coded strings related to old versions of
    FinTS (now they are computed at build time) and removed the table repeating
    stuff from file DESCRIPTION.
    
  o a number of minor edits and corrections in most Rd files.


Changes in Version 0.4-6

  o New maintainer - Georgi N. Boshnakov.

  o The URL in file DESCRIPTION had become inaccessible, the current one is
    http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ruey.tsay/teaching/fts2/.

    However, I (GB) think that this should be the development page of the
    package, so I changed it to https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/fints/.


Changes in Version 0.3-7

  o Added "See Also: 'file.path'" to the help file for 'package.dir' to make it
    easier to find.


Changes in Version 0.3-6

  o This is the first version to have a complete script for chapter 9.  The
    previous release had complete scripts for chapters 1-3 and partial scripts
    for chapters 4, 9, and 11.
