  \itemize{
    \item{ibm}{
      IBM transactions data (11/1/1990 - 1/31/1991)

      data.frame of date.time, volume, bid, ask, and price of IBM stock
      transactions.  date.time is of class 'chron', while volume, bid,
      ask, and price are all numeric.  Some tranactions have the same
      date.time values, which is why this is a data.frame and not a zoo
      object.
    }
    \item{ibm9912.tp}{
      IBM transactions data of December 1999:  data.frame of date.time
      and price.
    }
    \item{ibmdurad}{
      Adjusted time durations between trades of IBM stock
      (11/01/1990-1/31/1991).

      Format:  data.frame with columns date.time and adjusted.duration
    }
    \item{ibm1to5.dur}{
      subset of 'ibmdurad' limited to positive durations in the first 5
      trading days.
    }
    \item{ibm91.ads}{
      a data.frame on the changes in the price of IBM stock transactions
      between November 1, 1990 and January 31, 1991.  This period
      includes 63 trading days, during which 59,838 transactions were
      recorded during normal trading hours.  The first transcation for
      each day was dropped leaving the 59,775 transactions in this
      data.frame.

      \itemize{
	\item{A.priceChange}{
	  1 if a price change from the previous trade, 0 otherwise
	}
	\item{DirectionOfChg}{
	  1 if positive, -1 if negative, 0 if no change
	}
	\item{SizeInTicks}{
	  Size of the price change in number of ticks of 1/8 of a US
	  dollar.

	  NOTE:  There are 10 anomalous records for which A.priceChange
	  !=0 but SizeInTicks == 0 in this data.frame.  These correspond
	  to price changes of half a tick, which got rounded down to 0.
	}
      }
    }
    \item{ibm91.adsx}{
      a data.frame with 6 variables the same transactions as in
      'ibm91.ads':

      \itemize{
	\item{volume.thousands}{thousands of shares traded}
	\item{time.betw.trades}{seconds between the previous two trades}
	\item{bid.ask.spread}{
	  the bid-ask spread in USD of the current transaction.
	}
	\item{A.priceChange}{
	  1 if the previous trade involved a price change from its
	  predacessor, and 0 otherwise
	}
	\item{DirectionOfChg}{
	  1 if the previous change was positive, -1 if negative, 0 if no
	  change
	}
	\item{SizeInTicks}{
	  Size of the price change in the previous trade in number of
	  ticks of 1/8 of a US dollar.

	  NOTE:  The last three columns are ibm91.ads lagged one
	  transaction, so ibm91.adsx[-1, 4:5] == ibm91.ads[-59775, ],
	  with 24 exceptions.
	}
      }
    }
    \item{day15.ori}{
      data.frame with the transaction time and the stock price for the
      728 IBM stock transactions that occurred during normal trading
      hours on November 21, 1990.
    }
    \item{day15}{
      a zoo object with the following columns supposedly summarizing
      only the price changes in day15.ori:

      \itemize{
	\item{timeBetwPriceChg}{
	  time in seconds since the last price change
	}
	\item{DirectionOfChange}{
	  1 if the price increased, -1 if it decreased
	}
	\item{priceChgTicks}{
	  price change in number of ticks of USD 1/8.
	}
	\item{nTradesWoChg}{
	  number of trades without a price change since the previous
	  price change ... supposedly.  These numbers do not match a
	  manual extraction of these data from 'day15.ori'.
	}
	\item{multTrans}{
	  1 if there were multiple transactions within the same one
	  second interval, 0 if not.
	}
	\item{dailyCumChg}{
	  cumulative price change in USD since the start of normal
	  trading on November 21, 1990.
