\title{ Arima with Ljung-Box }
\description{
  Fit an ARIMA model and test residuals with the Ljung-Box statistic
}
\usage{
ARIMA(x, order = c(0, 0, 0),
     seasonal = list(order = c(0, 0, 0), period = NA),
     xreg = NULL, include.mean = TRUE, transform.pars = TRUE,
     fixed = NULL, init = NULL, method = c("CSS-ML", "ML", "CSS"),
     n.cond, optim.control = list(), kappa = 1e6, Box.test.lag=NULL,
     Box.test.df = c("net.lag", "lag"),
     type = c("Ljung-Box", "Box-Pierce", "rank"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    a univariate time series
  }
  \item{order}{
    A specification of the non-seasonal part of the ARIMA model:  the
    three components (p, d, q) are the AR order, the degree of
    differencing, and the MA order.
  }
  \item{seasonal}{
    A specification of the seasonal part of the ARIMA model, plus the
    period (which defaults to 'frequency(x)'). This should be a list
    with components 'order' and 'period', but a specification of just a
    numeric vector of length 3 will be turned into a suitable list with
    the specification as the 'order'.
  }
  \item{xreg}{
    Optionally, a vector or matrix of external regressors, which must
    have the same number of rows as 'x'.
  }
  \item{include.mean}{
    Should the ARMA model include a mean/intercept term?  The default is
    'TRUE' for undifferenced series, and it is ignored for ARIMA models
    with differencing.
  }
  \item{transform.pars}{
    Logical.  If true, the AR parameters are transformed to ensure that
    they remain in the region of stationarity.  Not used for 'method =
    "CSS"'.
  }
  \item{fixed}{
    optional numeric vector of the same length as the total number of
    parameters.  If supplied, only 'NA' entries in 'fixed' will be
    varied.  'transform.pars = TRUE' will be overridden (with a warning)
    if any AR parameters are fixed.  It may be wise to set
    'transform.pars = FALSE' when fixing MA parameters, especially near
    non-invertibility.
  }
  \item{init}{
    optional numeric vector of initial parameter values.  Missing values
    will be filled in, by zeroes except for regression coefficients.
    Values already specified in 'fixed' will be ignored.
  }
  \item{method}{
    Fitting method: maximum likelihood or minimize conditional
    sum-of-squares.  The default (unless there are missing values) is to
    use conditional-sum-of-squares to find starting values, then maximum
    likelihood.
  }
  \item{n.cond}{
    Only used if fitting by conditional-sum-of-squares: the number of
    initial observations to ignore.  It will be ignored if less than the
    maximum lag of an AR term.
  }
  \item{optim.control}{
    List of control parameters for 'optim'.
  }
  \item{kappa}{
    the prior variance (as a multiple of the innovations variance) for
    the past observations in a differenced model.  Do not reduce this.
  }
  \item{Box.test.lag}{
    the Box.test statistic will be based on 'Box.test.lag'
    autocorrelation coefficients of the whitened residuals.
    The default is the maximum of the following:
%    \itemize{
      \code{round(log(sum(!is.na(x))))}, recommended by Tsay (p. 27).

      One more than the number of parameters estimated, not counting any
      'intercept' in the model.
%    }
  }
  \item{Box.test.df}{
    numeric or character variable indicating the degrees of freedom for
    the ch-square approximation to the distribution of the Box.test
    statistic.  The default 'net.lag' is 'Box.test.lag' minus the number
    of relevant parameters estimated.  The primary alternative 'lag' is
    the number of lags included in the computation of the statistic.

    A positive number can also be provided.
  }
  \item{type}{
    which Box.test 'type' should be used?  Partial matching is used.

    The 'rank' alternative computes 'Ljung-Box' on rank(x);  see Burns
    (2002) and references therein.

    NOTE:  The default 'Ljung-Box' type generally seems to be more
    accurate and popular than the earlier 'Box-Pierce', which is however
    the default for 'Box.test'.
  }
}
\details{
  1.  Fit the desired model using 'arima'.

  2.  Compute the desired number of lags for Box.test

  3.  Apply 'AutocorTest' to the whitened residuals.

  NOTE:  Some software does not adjust the degrees of freedom for the
  number of parameters estimated.  Tsay (2005) and Enders (2004) do.
  The need to adjust the degrees of freedom discussed by Brockwell and
  Davis (1990), who provide a proof describing the circumstances under
  which this is appropriate.

  This is, however, an asymptotic result, and it would help to have
  simulation studies of the distribution of the Ljung-Box statistic,
  estimating degrees of freedom and evaluating goodness of fit.  Burns
  recommends a rank version of the Ljung-Box test, but does not estimate
  degrees of freedom.  If you have done such a simulation or know of a
  reference describing such, would you please notify the maintainer of
  this package?

  4.  If 'xreg' is supplied, compute r.squared.
}
\value{
  an 'arima' object with an additional 'Box.test' component and if
  'xreg' is not null, an 'r.squared' component.

  NOTE:  The 'Box.test' help page in R 2.6.1 says, 'Missing values are
  not handled.'  However, if 'x' contains NAs, 'ARIMA' still returns a
  numeric answer that seems plausible, at least in some examples.
  Therefore, either this comment on the help page is wrong (or obsolete)
  or the answer can not be trusted with NAs.
