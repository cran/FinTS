# The traditional PCA is not applicable to estimate the factor model
# because of the singularity of the covariance matrix.  The asymptotic
# PCA provides an approach to estimate factor model based on asymptotic
# properties. For the simple example considered, the sample size is
# $T$ = 36 and the dimension is $k$ = 40. If the number of factor is
# assumed to be 1, the APCA gives a summary of the factor loadings as
# below:
#
apca40 <- apca(M.apca0103, 1)
#
# (min, 1st Quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, max) =
# (0.069, 0.432, 0.629, 0.688, 1.071, 1.612).
#
# Note that the sign of any loading vector is not uniquely determined
# in the same way as the sign of an eigenvector is not uniquely
# determined. The output also contains the summary statistics of the
# R-squares of individual returns, i.e. the R-squares measuring the
# total variation of individual return explained by the factors. For
# the simple case considered, the summary of R-squares is (min, 1st
# Quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, max) =
# (0.090,0.287,0.487,0.456,0.574,0.831).
